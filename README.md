### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited to be working on Deep Learning @ [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en) NYC this fall! 

Previously, I also worked on Machine Learning @ [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/visitorcenter/default) Redmond.

Looking forwards to what the future will bring!

I'm also open to opportunities to collaborate, so feel free to reach out for a chat.
