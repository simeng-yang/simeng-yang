### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently MLE @ Meta NYC.

Previously, I completed an internship @ Facebook NYC, where I worked on machine learning models to drive product relevance for [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en) Shopping, and also worked on Machine Learning @ [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/visitorcenter/default) Redmond.

I graduated from the University of Waterloo's [Computer Science program](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) in December 2020.

I'm also open to opportunities to collaborate, so feel free to reach out for a chat.
