### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited to be working on Core ML @ [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en) NYC this fall! 

Previously, I also worked on Machine Learning @ [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/visitorcenter/default) Redmond.

I'll be graduating from the University of Waterloo's [Computer Science program](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) in April 2021 and am excited, but nervous about taking the plunge into the "real world"!

I'm also open to opportunities to collaborate, so feel free to reach out for a chat.
